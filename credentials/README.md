`/credentials` holds the credentials that the widgets need.

Currently, we have two services that require authentication. Note that both these files end in `.credential`, not `.txt`.


## WebHelpDesk
Requires a `webhelpdesk.credential` text file that looks like

    apikey

where `apikey` is a valid API key generated from WebHelpDesk.


## WhenToWork
Requires a `whentowork.credential` text file that looks like

    username
    password

where `username` and `password` are the user's username and password, respectively.


## Tightrope
Requires a `tightrope.credential` text file that looks like

    username
    password

where `username` and `password` are the user's username and password, respectively.
